      <h2>How we tested accessibility</h2>
      <p> We used ligthhouse in microsoft edge and Wave web accessibility evaluation tool to evaluate the site pages
        accessibility. To use these tests firstly download the extension live server. After that paste the live
        server link in edge and go to settings and developer tools. Then click on lighthouse and run the tests for
        phone and pc view. To use wave i forked the github repository and ran the repo on my own github pages. After
        github pages is set up i paste the link from github pages into Wave and get the results.

      <h3>The page we used to test accesibility</h3>
      <p>
        For the accessibility test we decided to use the page topical to present. The page had already a high
        accessibility test score something that indicates the students had a high comprehension of the accessibility
        lecture. But you can always be better with accessibility and the test showcased where the webpage hade low
        contrast. Having low contrast make the website harder to read espeacially for the visually impaired and
        elderly. So that is what we had to fix! We also testet our outher pages because you can never be to accesible.

      <h3>What we did to improve accessibility</h3>
      <p>To fix these changes we changes the colors of the low contrasting text to text with higher contrasting
        colors making the text more visible and easier to see. Other things we have done to make our page more
        accesible is to have descriptive alt text on all images. We have also tried scaling our website down and see
        how readable our text is. Making sure that no text is to small to be able to read is important to make sure
        the site does not become less accessible for thoose with vision impairment. And that is something that we dont
        want.

      <h3>Structure of the page</h3>
      <p>We have also used text shadow on some of the h1 tags to increase readability and make the h1 tags stand out
        from the background. Having text blend into to the background may cause the viewer of the page to not
        clearly see what is meant to be presented on the page. This results in a worse overall viewing experience,
        and worse accessibility. We have also followed guidelines give to us på the Wave accessibility evaluation tool.
        For example here you can see the tools says we have a good structure </p>
