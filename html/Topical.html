          <h2>Digitalization</h2>
          <p>Digital technology has opened new ways of collecting data and new ways of processing data. This has
            expanded the possibilities for how data about a city can be gathered and how this data can be combined and
            analyzed to give insights that can be used in planning and administration. In this video, Marikken Wullf
            Wathne, Ph.D. candidate at NIBR - Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, will elaborate on how
            digital technologies are being used in what is commonly known as "smart city" - initiatives, and present
            some of the debates around the digitization of urban governance.</p>
          <p>The social credit systems that are emerging in China are much debated. These systems collect a variety of
            data about citizens and calculate a score that can be used to award benefits as well as remove privileges.

          <p>Around 2016, Sidewalk Labs, part of the Google and/or Alphabet, proposed the building of an entirely new
            smart neighborhood within the city of Toronto. The project ultimately failed, but still show the ambitions
            of tech companies, not limited to Google, but also Microsoft, Cisco, etc., moving from the virtual to the
            physical realm.</p>
          <h3>Digitalization in healhcare</h3>
          <p>The digitization of health- and welfare services can be a means of spending scarce resources more
            efficiently. Digital services can also provide flexibility so that clients and patients will be better able
            to integrate treatment and welfare programs in their daily life. At the same time, there are challenges
            connected to the digitization in the health- and welfare sector.

          <p>Digital platforms make it possible for public agencies to develop self-service solutions, such as applying
            for social benefits. The authors of this paper understand do-it-yourself-services in the public sector as a
            delegation of work tasks to the citizens and discusses implications of this. If you read the abstract,
            introduction, and conclusion you will get an overview of their argument.</p>

            <p>In Australia, half a million recipients of welfare benefits received unlawful demands for repayment. This
            was caused by erratic algorithms. Read about the Robodebt scandal here:</p>
